        </div>
        <p className='aboutIntro'>"As a Real Estate Agent at the Top of the field, my goals are to have my clients become
        successful in the selling or purchasing of their next investment or property. To help my
        clients in the buying and selling process, I provide the tools to make educated choices with
        their investments, whether that be a vacant lot or a new home. Success is measured in the excitement my clients get when they close on their new
        property. When they succeed, I also do. Success for everyone is in the relationships we build. I reach out to all my clients
        as if they were my neighbors. We'll all grow in our business relationship and make a new friend.
        Let's make the move together."</p>

                    <p>"Jorge made the process simple and easy. Very professional, great personality,
                    honest, patience, great communication regularly through the whole process! His
                    insight to me was extremely valuable, very helpful! I would highly recommend Jorge!"</p>

                    <h1>Quinto</h1>
                    <p>Jorge is an extremely knowledgable real estate agent, well versed in all aspects of
                    the sale. Throughout the entire process, Jorge responded quickly to my calls and
                    had answers for any concerns. He kept me updated and helped me make some
                    major decisions. I would highly recommend Jorge Sousa to anyone looking for a
                    competent and dedicated agent.</p>

                    <h1>Tonia</h1>
                    <p>Jorge was top notch. He came right and had my house on the market in no time. The house had
                    more showings then I could keep up with day one with multiple offers and by end of day we had a
                    cash offer over asking and fast closing date. Which is what I needed!!! He's super nice and a breeze
                    to work with. Don't hesitate to list with him. I highly recommend it.</p>

                    <p>The real estate transaction he conducted on my behalf was a bit unique as I live 1,500 miles away. Jorge took the reins and exceeded my expectations at every turn â€“ from cleaning the home to making frequent visits prior to conducting showings. From my experience, this is not the norm, it is the exception.</p>

                    <p>He was amazing from beginning to closing. He helped me through the process when I was ready to
                    back out. He helped calm me down and helped me understand the steps to buying a new home. He
                    answered every message, text and email. He had the answers or he inquired about the answers for me.
                    Helped with the inspections and my lender's needs. At closing he even gave me a gift. Which was
                    thoughtful and amazing.</p>
